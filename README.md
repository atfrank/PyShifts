# Pyshifts
Pyshifts: A Pymol Plugin for Chemical Shift-Based Analysis of Biomolecular Ensembles

## Prerequisite
* [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/)

* [xQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org) (mac only)

* For first time PyMOL user, you will need a [PyMOL license file](https://pymol.org/2/buy.html?q=buy), as PyMOL is a commercial software.

## Quick Start

### Install Dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/atfrank/PyShifts.git
cd PyShifts
. setup.sh
```
The following commands will invoke a pymol window
```
conda activate pyshifts
source ~/.bashrc
pymol
```

### Adding Pyshifts to PyMOL

In PyMOL window, go to `Plugin` -> `Plugin manager` -> `Install new plugin`, choose `Pyshifts.py` file in your local Pyshifts folder, and click `OK` on the next step. You will then see a pop-up message `Plugin "PyShiftsPlugin" has been installed`.


### Using Pyshifts

#### Open PyMOL
##### set paths, e.g.:
```
export PYSHIFTS_PATH=~/Downloads/PyShifts
export PATH=$PYSHIFTS_PATH:$PATH
export BME=~/Downloads/PyShifts/BME
export PYTHONPATH=$BME:$PATH

export LARMORD_BIN=~/Downloads/PyShifts/LarmorD_New/bin
export PATH=$LARMORD_BIN:$PATH
export LARMORCA_BIN=~/Downloads/PyShifts/LARMORCA/bin
export PATH=$LARMORCA_BIN:$PATH
```
##### open 
```
pymol
```

#### Load Object
Load the object to be analyzed in PyMOL, e.g. `2KOC_test.pdb` provided in `test/` folder, by typing `load test/2KOC_test.pdb` in pymol command line or dragging the file into PyMOL window.

#### Run Pyshifts
Run Pyshifts through `Plugin` -> `Legacy Plugins` ->   `Pyshifts`.


#### Analysis in Pyshifts
- Change the `PyMOL selection/ object` entry to the name of your target object, e.g. `2KOC_test` and clink on `Run`.

- Go to the second tab `Error Analysis`, and click on `Compare shifts`.

- Click on `Error table` or  `CS table` to save results.


### Pyshifts Tabs

Pyshifts has four tabs and one `Exit` button. The first tab `Options` include basic options for `Pyshifts`, the second tab `Error Analysis` performs chemical shift comparison, displays table results and provides options in different ways of sorting.

The third tab `Advanced Options` contains functionality for parameter tuning. There are options on chemical shift error offset, accuracy, PyMOL rendering setting as well as machine learning clustering parameters.
