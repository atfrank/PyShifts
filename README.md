# PyShifts
A Pymol Plugin for Assessing the Global Quality of RNA Structures Using NMR Chemical Shifts


NMR spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful tool for determining the complex architecture of non-coding RNAs, 
but assessing the quality of NMR-derived structures remains problematic in the field of RNA structural biology. 
We demonstrate that chemical shifts can serve as conformational “fingerprints” that can accurately assess the global quality of NMR 
structures of RNA. This was accomplished by carefully comparing observed and computed chemical shifts for pairs of 
NMR structures of the same RNA, one of which is known to be a better set of atomic coordinates.
 We discovered that in 7 out of 8 cases, we were able to correctly identify the more “accurate” NMR structure of the studied pairs. 
 The promising results described in this report should pave the way for the development of tools that utilize chemical shifts to assess the global quality of NMR structures of RNA. As an initial step in this direction, we developed a graphical analysis and quality assessment tool, PyShifts, which we make freely available.
